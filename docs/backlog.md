# Backlog

This file mirrors the GitHub Issues backlog. GitHub Issues are the source of truth after repository setup; keep this document as a local planning summary.

## P0

### Performance: make prototype reports lazy-loaded
- Area: infra, web
- Problem: the prototype currently waits for almost every report plus cohort/source/TOC breakdowns before marking runtime data ready.
- Expected behavior: initial render should load only shared metadata and the active scene data; heavy reports should load by active screen or in background.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Opening the dashboard does not wait for all screens.
  - Sales, activities, cohorts, and funnel screens can load their own report bundles independently.
  - No direct Bitrix calls are added to page rendering.
  - Existing API/web tests remain green.

### Governance: keep reporting scoped to attraction managers
- Area: infra, api
- Problem: operational rows must never show managers outside the agreed attraction whitelist.
- Expected behavior: sales, calls, SLA, activities, manager action-outcome, cohorts, and funnel overlays use the same manager scope unless the user explicitly filters narrower.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Default report rows contain only the seven agreed managers.
  - Activities, calls, and action-outcome reports cannot reintroduce outside managers through related activities or calls.
  - Regression tests cover this rule.

## P1

### Sales planning tab: plan percent and "as is vs required"
- Area: sales
- Problem: comments ask for planning, percentage of plan, and forecast logic instead of just factual KPI tables.
- Expected behavior: add a `Планирование` tab with plan progress and required action volume versus actual action volume.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Shows `% от плана`.
  - Shows `как есть` and `как надо` rows.
  - Supports manager and cohort filters.
  - Uses conditional formatting outside the neutral `±15%` band.
- Data dependencies:
  - Need plan source and granularity: total, manager, source, month.

### Cohort action-outcome model
- Area: sales, cohorts
- Problem: actions should be counted against the selected deal cohort, not only the current activity period.
- Expected behavior: for selected cohort, show actions and outcomes by manager and deal status.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Mini-filter allows choosing cohort.
  - Metrics are calculated for deals created in the cohort.
  - Split outcomes into accepted by club, lost, and WIP.
  - Shows action volume for each outcome status.

### Activities operational base and SLA improvements
- Area: activities
- Problem: activities screen needs WIP deals, active base, and clearer SLA semantics.
- Expected behavior: manager summary includes WIP, active base, and SLA fulfillment percentages.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Adds WIP deals.
  - Adds active base report: last communication not older than one month.
  - Adds quality `Готов ко встрече` and source cuts.
  - SLA displays fulfillment percent.
  - SLA late count `0` is neutral/gray.
  - Conditional formatting uses `±15%` deviation band.

### Financial result by source, quality, and events
- Area: sales, activities
- Problem: comments ask for lead acquisition cost, event cost, and earnings.
- Expected behavior: add financial-result block showing costs and earned amount by source/quality/event.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Shows lead purchase cost by source and quality.
  - Shows event costs.
  - Shows earned amount.
  - Shows attraction average check and club average check.
- Data dependencies:
  - Need earning formula by customer and contract/tariff type.
  - Need cost source for leads and events.

### Cohort matrix count plus conversion
- Area: cohorts
- Problem: cohort cells need both absolute deal counts and conversion, and rows need created deal count.
- Expected behavior: cohort matrix includes created deals and each cell is split into count plus conversion.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Adds created deals column.
  - Each cohort cell displays absolute count and conversion.
  - Existing cohort filters continue to work.

### Funnel stable leaders at bottlenecks
- Area: funnel
- Problem: stable leaders should be detected in important funnel places, not just listed generically.
- Expected behavior: strong managers are shown as an overlay on stages/bottlenecks with stability versus compare period.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Uses compare-aware manager stage conversion.
  - Marks stability by rank retention and conversion threshold.
  - Links the finding to bottleneck/queue context.

## Needs Clarification

### Plan source
- What is the source of plan values?
- Should plan be monthly, weekly, by manager, by source, or global?

### Attraction economics
- How much does attraction earn by customer, contract type, and tariff?
- What is the difference between attraction average check and club average check?

### Cost data
- Where do lead purchase costs and event costs live?
- Are they imported, configured manually, or entered per period?

### SLA color rules
- Confirm exact coloring besides `late = 0` being gray.
- Confirm whether the `±15%` deviation rule applies to SLA, plan, and action-outcome blocks equally.
