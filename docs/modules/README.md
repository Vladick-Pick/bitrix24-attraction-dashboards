# Dashboard Modules

Each business module must have a module ontology before Paperclip agents or dashboard code are expected to work reliably.

For cross-module relationships and the shared/platform contract, see
[`CONTEXT-MAP.md`](../../CONTEXT-MAP.md).

Module ontology is not a narrative description. It is the operating contract for:

- what entities exist;
- which roles can see or change what;
- what states and transitions are valid;
- which reports and metrics belong to the module;
- what source systems and data scopes are allowed;
- what personal data must be excluded from storage, UI, and Paperclip payloads.

## Required File

Every module gets:

```text
docs/modules/<module-key>/MODULE_ONTOLOGY.md
```

Current modules:

- `attraction`: `docs/modules/attraction/MODULE_ONTOLOGY.md`
- `leadgen`: `docs/modules/leadgen/MODULE_ONTOLOGY.md`

Use `docs/modules/attraction/MODULE_ONTOLOGY.md` as the V1 platform example, but do not force new modules into the attraction UI or report semantics. `leadgen` has its own funnel, manager whitelist, report registry, and Paperclip context.

Paperclip uses one company and one shared GitHub repository, but module-specific
projects for dashboard-comment routing:

- `attraction` -> `Attraction Dashboard`
- `leadgen` -> `Leadgen Dashboard`

Weekly manager routines are company-level and should not be attached to either
module project.
